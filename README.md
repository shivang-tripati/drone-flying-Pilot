# My Pilot Search Application

## Description

This application allows users to find pilots within a specified range from their location. Users can input their latitude, longitude, and range (in kilometers), and the application will display all pilots within that range on a map. The application also includes a map view that dynamically updates based on the pilots' locations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Map**: View pilots on an interactive map using Leaflet.
- **Range Filter**: Filter pilots based on a specified range from the user's location.
- **Live Location**: Show the admin's live location on the map.
